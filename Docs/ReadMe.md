# ILGPU Tutorials

## Primers (How a GPU works)

This series introduces how a GPU works and what ILGPU does. If you have programmed with CUDA or OpenCL 
before you can probably skip 01 and 02.

00 [Setting up ILGPU](Primer_00.md) (ILGPU version 1.0.0-beta2)

01 [A GPU is not a CPU](Primer_01.md) (ILGPU version 1.0.0-beta2)
> This page will provide a quick rundown the basics of how kernels (think GPU programs) run.

02 [Memory and bandwidth and threads. Oh my!](Primer_02.md)  
> This will hopefully give you a better understanding of how memory works in hardware and the performance
> implications.

## Beginner (How ILGPU works)

This series is meant to be a brief overview of ILGPU and how to use it. It assumes you have at least a little knowledge of how Cuda or OpenCL work. 
If you need a primer look to something like [this for Cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/about-cuda) or [this for OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/)

01 [Context and Accelerators](Tutorial_01.md) (ILGPU version 1.0.0-beta2)
> This tutorial covers the creating the Context and Accelerator objects which setup ILGPU for use. 
> It's mostly boiler plate and does no computation but it does print info about your GPU if you have one.
> There is some advice about ILGPU in here that makes it worth the quick read.

02 [MemoryBuffers and ArrayViews](Tutorial_02.md) (ILGPU version 1.0.0-beta2)
> This tutorial covers the basics for Host / Device memory management.

03 [Kernels and Simple Programs](Tutorial_03.md) (ILGPU version 1.0.0-beta2)
> This is where it all comes together. This covers actual code, on the actual GPU (or the CPU if you are testing / dont have a GPU). 

04 [Structs and the N-body problem](Tutorial_04.md) (ILGPU version 1.0.0-beta2)
> This tutorial actually does something! We use computing the N-body problem as a sample of how to better manage Host / Device memory.

## Beginner II (Something more interesting)

Well at least I think. This is where I will put ILGPUView bitmap shader things I (or other people if they want to) eventually write. Below are the few I have planned / think would be easy.

1. Ray Tracing in One Weekend based raytracer
2. Cloud Simulation
2. 2D Physics Simulation
3. Other things I see on shadertoy
