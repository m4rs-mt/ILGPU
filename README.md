# ILGPU

ILGPU is a JIT (just-in-time) compiler for high-performance GPU programs written in .Net-based languages.
ILGPU is entirely written in C# without any native dependencies.
It offers the flexibility and the convenience of C++ AMP on the one hand and the high performance of Cuda programs on the other hand.
Functions in the scope of kernels do not have to be annotated (default C# functions) and are allowed to work on value types.
All kernels (including all hardware features like shared memory and atomics) can be executed and debugged on the CPU using the integrated multi-threaded CPU accelerator.

# Build Instructions

ILGPU requires Visual Studio 2019 (Community edition or higher).

Use the provided Visual Studio solution to build the ILGPU libs
in the desired configurations (Debug/Release).

Note: T4 (*.tt) text templates must be converted manually depending on the Visual Studio version.
To transform them, right-click a text template and select `Run Custom Tool`.
Alternatively, you can open and save any text template in Visual Studio.

# Tests

Sometimes the XUnit test runner stops execution when all tests are run in parallel.
This is not a problem related to the internal tests, but a known XUnit/Visual Studio problem.
If the tests stop unexpectedly, you can simply run the remaining tests again to continue working.

Note: You can unload ILGPU.Tests.Cuda (for example) if you do not have a Cuda-capable device to
execute the Cuda test cases.

# General Contribution Guidelines

* Make sure that you agree with the general coding style (in terms of braces, whitespaces etc.).
* Make sure that ILGPU compiles without warnings in all build modes (Debug, DebugVerification and Release).
