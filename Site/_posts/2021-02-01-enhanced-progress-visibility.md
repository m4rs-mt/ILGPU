Starting in February 2021, an updated ILGPU version will be available every 6-8 weeks. As the community grows, new
features will be explicitly tracked on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/m4rs-mt/ILGPU/issues) and are linked
to their appropriate milestone to which they belong.

Each new feature found on this page and is marked with a specific
difficulty level (beginner, intermediate and advanced).
At the beginning, we strongly recommend that you take a closer look at the *beginner* issues if you plan to contribute
to the ILGPU project.
